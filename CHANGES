We've managed to reach the second major version by doing a huge restructure that caused us to delete three libraries to clean things up!

### Changes

This release contains a variety of changes, including, but not limited to:

- `[*]` Merged `Textify.Data.Analysis` to `Textify.Data`
- `[*]` Merged `Textify.Json` and `Textify.Figlet` to `Textify`
